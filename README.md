### Dev Notes
- Decided to go with GoCraft for framework as it is super fast and minimal. It also 
has nested routers, contexts, and middleware.
- Decided to use JWT as it stateless self contained token which has authetication 
information, expire time information, and other user defined claims 
digitally signed. Portable: A single token can be used with multiple backends. Good Performance: It reduces the network round trip time
